        The Emperor penguin is the largest penguin species in the world. 
        This bird is a rather interesting species from a biological standpoint. 
        The Emperor penguin has streamlined plumage, consisting of shiny, water-repellent feathers,
        which prevent the skin from getting wet. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The webbed feet of the animal make swimming much easier. 
        The head is big, the neck is short and thick, and the tail is wedge-shaped and short. The tiny wings 
        of the penguin resemble flippers by their shape. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The blackish-blue head is covered with large white and 
        yellow markings on the ears of the animal. The upperparts are blue-grey while the underparts are white, 
        except with the upper breast, having a pale yellow coloring. Males and females are alike.

    These birds are non-migratory, living deep in the Southern Ocean throughout the year. 
    Emperor penguins can be active at any time of the night and day. They are highly social 
    birds, gathering in groups to forage and nest. They form large nesting colonies;
    </p>
    <p>
    if the weather is good and usually defend only small areas around them. When it gets 
    too cold, the birds huddle together. Breeding adults have to constantly travel between 
    the nesting and foraging areas all year round. When in water, Emperor penguins are excellent 
    swimmers; 
    </p>
    <p>
    when on land, they either walk with the identifying waddling gait or slide over 
    the ice surface on their bellies, propelling themselves with their feet.
    </p>

    <h1>Diet and Nutrition</h1>
    <div class = "page_text">
    <p>This penguin is a carnivore (piscivore and molluscivore), 
        feeding exclusively upon aquatic animals. 
        Their diet mainly consists of krill and fish, 
        supplemented with squid and crustaceans.</p>
    </div>

    <h1>Mating Habits</h1>
    <div class = "page_text">
        <p>
        The Emperor penguins have serially monogamous system, 
        mating with only one mate during each season. In March-April, 
        the birds return to their breeding colonies. The gestation period 
        lasts for 63 days. 
        </p>
        <p>   
        Usually, a female penguin lays a single egg, leaving 
        it to the male, and going out to sea. The male is responsible for keeping 
        the egg warm, carrying it on his feet, and incubating the egg for 9 weeks. 
        The hatching occurs after 70 days, which matches the return of the female. 
        </p>
        <p>
        When the chick hatch out, the male leaves to forage, and this time the female 
        has to care for the hatchling, feeding it and keeping it warm. The chicks of 
        the Emperor penguin grow up quite rapidly. Reaching the age of 150 days, 
        the young fledge. Male penguins start breeding at 5-6 years 
        old while females - at 5 years of age.

    <h1>Population</h1>

    <h2>Population threats</h2>

    <p>Global warming negatively affects the population of these animals, 
        decreasing the area of pack ice, which is the natural habitat of the 
        Emperor penguins. Another concern is fishing vessels that sometimes 
        accidentally catch these penguins in their nets.
    </p>

    <h2>Population number</h2>

    <p>The overall estimated population of these penguins is about 595,000 mature individuals. 
        Despite the fact, that the total population of the Emperor penguin is presently stable, 
        on the IUCN Red List the species is classified as Near Threatened.</p>

    <h2>Ecological niche</h2>

    <p>Emperor penguins are an irreplaceable link in the ecosystem of their range. 
        These birds consume various marine species such as small fish, cephalopods,
         or crustaceans. Besides, penguins are an important source of food for larger 
         local predators, including leopard seals and large sharks.</p>
