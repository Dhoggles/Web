        The Blue whale has a huge long, slim, narrow body.
        Its skin is hairless and smooth, and is grayish blue,
        lighter on the underside, with a series of grooves on the throat.
        </p>
        <p>
        Its large tail is straight, splitting at the end into two rubbery flukes.
        Blue whales are part of the "baleen whales" group, having, instead of teeth,
        up to 395 hard, bristly baleen plates that descend from the upper jaw.
        </p>
        <p>
        These plates are used to filter seawater for food. They have two blow-holes
        that expel stale air and seawater out of the top of their heads when they
        come up to the surface to breathe.
        </p>

    <h1>Habits and Lifestyle</h1>

    <div class = "photo_text">
    <p>Blue whales are generally solitary creatures
    that may spend some time in pairs and occasionally come
    together in casual groups to feed. 
    </p>
    <p>
    They communicate with
    each other using a variety of sounds or songs, including squeaks,
    hums, and rumbles, mainly during the breeding season, which is in winter.
    The sounds Blue whales make are extremely loud, the loudest of any animal
    on the planet, and they have been recorded at higher than 180 decibels.
    </p>
    <p>
    They use their tails to perform deep dives, as by lifting their tail above
    the water's surface, they muster enough power to dive up to 200 meters
    straight down into the sea. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Blue whales feed through lunge feeding;
    they swim towards krill ast high speeds as they open their mouths up to 80Â°.
    While pursuing krill patches, Blue whales maximize their calorie intake by
    increasing the number of lunges while selecting the thickest patches.
    This provides them enough energy for everyday activities while storing
    additional energy necessary for migration and reproduction.</p>
    </div>
    </div>

    <h1>Diet and Nutrition</h1>
    <div class = "page_text">
    <p>Blue whales are carnivorous (piscivorous).
    Their diet mainly consists of krill and small crustaceans,
    although they will occasionally eat small fish.</p>
    </div>

    <h1>Mating Habits</h1>
    <div class = "page_text">
    <p>Blue whales are monogamous, mating during winter or early spring
    in warmer, tropical waters. Gestation lasts for almost a year,
    the female giving birth to one calf when she returns to the region
    the next year. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Having spent all summer feeding in the cold, rich waters
    of the Antarctic, the mothers eat almost nothing during the time they are
    providing their young with milk. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Baby blue whales stay with their mother
    for at least a year and are weaned at about 8 months old. Blue whales can
    start reproducing between the age of 10-15 years old, producing a calf
    every 2 or 3 years.</p>
    </div>

    <h1>Population</h1>

        <img src="Assets/blue_whale_ph5.jpg" width="700px">

    <h2>Population threats</h2>

    <p>Blue whales have almost no natural predators,
    due to their enormous size. The calves may be at
    risk of predation by large sharks and orcas.
    </p>
    <p>
    Humans hunted them so much throughout the 20th
    century that they almost became extinct. Globally,
    there appear to be no major threats to Blue whales at present.
    They can be subject to some ship strikes and entanglements
    but reported cases are few.</p>

    <h2>Population number</h2>

    <p>According to IUCN Red List, the global population
    size of the Blue whale in 2018 is plausibly in the
    range of 10,000-25,000 individuals or 5,000-15,000 mature individuals.
    Currently, this species is classified as Endangered (EN)
    on the IUCN Red List and its numbers today are increasing.</p>

    <h2>Ecological niche</h2>

    <p>As with other large baleen whales,
    Blue whales are significant predators of
    krill and control their populations.</p>
