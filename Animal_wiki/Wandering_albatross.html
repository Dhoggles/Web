        Described as "The bird which made the breeze to blow" 
        the wingspan of a Wandering albatross is the longest of any bird.
        It lives up to its name when it takes fishing trips that last 10-20 
        days and can cover 10,000 km while using hardly more energy than when 
        sitting on its nest. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Despite its large size, this bird is wonderfully 
        adapted for the soaring flight and is able to glide for hours before needing
        to flap its wings in order to regain height. 
        </p>
        <p>
        A Wandering albatross spends all
        its time at sea, aside from when it is breeding, far from even any islands. It 
        sleeps on the water's surface, during the day gliding and flying, searching for food, which is abundant.

        <p>
        Wandering albatrosses spend most of their life in flight, 
        landing only to breed and feed. While foraging at sea in the daytime, 
        these birds travel in small groups. Sometimes there are large feeding 
        frenzies around fishing boats. 
        </p>
        <p>
        An individual may fly thousands of kilometers 
        from its breeding grounds, sometimes crossing the equator. In the breeding 
        season, a Wandering albatross is gregarious and performs a range of displays. 
        Vocalizations and displays are common when mating or defending territory and 
        include croaks, bill-touching, bill-clapping, pointing to the sky, trumpeting, 
        head-shaking, the “gawky look” and the "ecstatic" gesture. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Individuals sometimes 
        vocalize when they are fighting over food. These birds usually disperse over the 
        Southern Ocean once the breeding season ends, and most of them probably travel east, 
        perhaps in a circumpolar movement.
        </p>

    <h1>Diet and Nutrition</h1>
    <div class = "page_text">
    <p>Wandering albatrosses are carnivores (piscivores and molluscivores), 
        they mainly eat fish, including toothfish, squid, 
        and other cephalopods, and the occasional crustacean.</p>
    </div>

    <h1>Mating Habits</h1>
    <div class = "page_text">
        <p>
        Wandering albatrosses are monogamous and pairs mate for life. 
        Courtship displays are the same as other species, with bill-circling,
        sky-pointing, mutual preening, and spreading wings. Both males and
        females perform some dances while raising their spread wings and calling.
        </p>
        <p>
        The pair will only defend a small territory around their nest. 
        Fights may occur, but these are usually over food. 
        Breeding is from December until March. This species breeds 
        in loose colonies, and typically the nests are in scattered groups.
        </p> 
        <p>
        Nests are a mound of mud and grass on the ground of the slopes, among 
        the sparse vegetation. A single creamy-white egg is laid, and both parents 
        take turns incubating for periods of 2-3 weeks over 78 days. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The downy white 
        chick is brooded for 4-5 weeks, being fed by regurgitation, and remaining on 
        the nest for around 9 months. Once it fledges, it flies out to sea, returning
        to the colony after 5-6 years. It will not start breeding until it is 11-15 years old.
        </p>

    <h1>Population</h1>

    <div class = "photo_table">

    <h2>Population threats</h2>

        <p>
        Wandering albatrosses are relatively well protected, 
        due to both their remote location and certain laws. However, 
        its numbers are still slowly declining. The most likely cause is 
        longline fishing, as they become hooked and will drown, as well as 
        the ingestion of plastics, which kills both chicks and adults. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Once hunted for their feathers to decorate women's hats, this 
        practice has disappeared due to changes in fashion. 
        On Kerguelen Island, feral cats have killed entire broods of chicks.
        </p>

    <h2>Population number</h2>

    <p>According to IUCN's Red List, the current estimates for Wandering 
        albatrosses in specific areas are: on South Georgia (Georgias del Sur), 
        1,553 pairs; on Prince Edward Island, 1,800 pairs; on Marion Island, 
        2,056 pairs; on Iles Crozet, 340 pairs; on Iles Kerguelen, 354 pairs; 
        and on Macquarie Island, 4 pairs, a total of 6,107 breeding pairs, 
        equating to about 20,100 mature individuals. Overall, currently, 
        Wandering albatrosses are classified as Vulnerable (VU) and their 
        numbers today are decreasing.</p>
